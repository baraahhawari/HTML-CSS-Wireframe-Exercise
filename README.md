# HTML-CSS-Wireframe-Exercise

Practice building out a professional-style wire-frame document. It's done only by using HTML and CSS.

**Professional wireframes** are supposed to keep the presentation of the site **simple** without any additional content.

- The whole point of a wireframe is to get the layout figured out, while the real content can get **added** in the future.
- Wireframes allow the client to drive what layouts they like and what they donâ€™t like.
